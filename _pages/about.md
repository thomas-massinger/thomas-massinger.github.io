I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar at Caltech working on the detection of gravitational waves from compact binary 
systems and characterization of the Advanced LIGO detectors. I earned my Ph.D from Syracuse University in 2016. 
I'm interested in signal processing, data visualization, teaching, and data science.
