I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar at Caltech working on the detection of gravitational waves from compact binary 
systems and characterization of the Advanced LIGO detectors. 

Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by the motion of massive objects. Of particular interest 
to me are compact binary coalescences - the inspiral and merger of two compact objects such as black holes 
or neutron stars. As these systems emit energy in the form of gravitational waves, their orbit collapses and 
they eventually collide and merge. The gravitational waves they emitted propagate through spacetime 
at the speed of light, sometimes for billions of years, before eventually reaching Earth. 

When a gravitational wave passes through matter, it stretches and squeezes spacetime, changing the distance 
between objects. The Advanced LIGO detectors were built to measure this changing distance between test masses 
spaced 4 km apart. The Advanced LIGO detectors are dual-recycled Michelson interferometers with 4 km arms. 
As a gravitational wave passes through the detector, one arm is stretched and the other is squeezed, resulting 
in an interferometric signal which is read out on a photodetector. The signal from this photodetector is 
searched for the gravitational wave patterns predicted by General Relativity. Advanced LIGO has detected 6 
transient gravitational wave signals so far - 5 from binary black hole mergers 
and 1 from a binary neutron star merger.
