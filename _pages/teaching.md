* Guest Lecturer, Graduate classical mechanics, Caltech

  I was a guest lecturer for two sections of a graduate level mechanics course at the 
  California Institute of Technology. I prepared lecture notes based on a set 
  of topics from the course's instructor and taught classes of roughly 25 
  students. These lectures included advanced mechanics topics 
  such as Hamilton-Jacobi theory, canonical transformations, action-angle variables, 
  infinitesimal rotations, and vectors in rotating reference frames.

* Instructor, Syracuse University

  I was the primary instructor and lecturer for the 
  Graduate Problem Solving course at Syracuse University. 
  The purpose of this course is to prepare the first year graduate 
  students for their Ph.D qualifying exam. My duties as the 
  instructor of this course included writing and delivering 
  lectures on graduate level physics, walking through problem-
  solving techniques, writing quizzes and homework assignments, and 
  evaluating the students as they prepared for their qualifying 
  exams. The materials for this course included graduate level 
  topics from Classical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Statistical 
  Mechanics, and Electricity & Magnetism.

* Physics Teaching Assistant, Syracuse University

  The second year of my Ph.D program included experience as a 
  general physics teaching assistant. My duties included leading 
  weekly recitation sessions (roughly 20 students each) for Physics 
  I & II, grading homework assignments, and providing general 
  physics and astronomy tutoring in the Syracuse University physics 
  clinic. The recitation sessions often included lectures and 
  discussion of general problem-solving strategies with the 
  students.

* Astronomy Lab Assistant, Syracuse University

  The first year of my Ph.D included experience as an astronomy lab 
  teaching assistant. I was the instructor for weekly astronomy lab 
  sessions of roughly 15 students each. These lab sessions required 
  me to provide a short lecture and description of the experiment 
  at the beginning of the class, continued guidance throughout the 
  students' experiments, and debugging of laboratory equipment. I 
  was also a tutor for general physics and astronomy at the 
  Syracuse University physics clinic.
