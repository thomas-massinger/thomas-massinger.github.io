* Guest Lecturer, Graduate classical mechanics, Caltech
  I was a guest lecturer for two sections of a graduate level mechanics course at the 
  California Institute of Technology. I prepared lecture notes based on a set 
  of topics from the course's instructor and taught classes of roughly 25 
  students. These lectures included advanced mechanics topics 
  such as Hamilton-Jacobi theory, canonical transformations, action-angle variables, 
  infinitesimal rotations, and vectors in rotating reference frames.
